## Other Details

Right now I'm using [LordGuenni](https://github.com/LordGuenni)'s fork for both the dockerfile/image and the screenshare changes, but I'd like to move to my own dockerfile that doesn't use injection in the future. Huge shoutout to [LordGuenni](https://github.com/LordGuenni) for the screensharing/dockerfile and [baptisterajaut](https://github.com/baptisterajaut) for being the main one supporting self-hosted instances right now (2026-02-15).
